# Neural Networks: Zero to Hero
- A course by Andrej Karpathy on building neural networks, from scratch, in code. 
- It starts with foundational concepts like backpropagation and progresses towards complex models like GPT. 
- The course emphasizes language models as an effective starting point for learning deep learning due to the broad applicability of the gained knowledge.
